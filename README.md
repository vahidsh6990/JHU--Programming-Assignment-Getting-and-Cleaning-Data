# JHU--Programming-Assignment-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
This is the repository of **Vahid Shadram** containing the assignment done for John Hopkins University. This is done for the course: Getting and Cleaning data. 
Here I have uploaded the Newdata, r_analysis.R, and the codebook, all of which help you make the following link of data tidy:

These are the steps taken to prepare the tidy file, Newdata, in r_analysis.R:
1) It merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) It extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3) It uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) It labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5) From the data set in step 4, it creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
