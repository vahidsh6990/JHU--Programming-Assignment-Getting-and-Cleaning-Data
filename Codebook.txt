The uploaded file contains several steps to make the data tidy and also create a new set of data.
1. The untidy data is downloaded and extracted in a folder called UCI HAR Dataset
2. We assign appropriate names to variables:
•	features. txt -> features
•	activity_labels.txt -> activities
•	subject_test.txt -> subject_test
•	x_test.txt -> x_test
•	y_test.txt -> y_test
•	subject_train.txt -> subject_train
•	x_train.txt -> x_train
•	y_train.txt -> y_train
3. We use ‘rbind()’ function to merge data:
x = x_train + x_test
y = y_train + y_test
subject = subject_train + subject_test
Therefore, we can have the final data using ‘cbind()’ function
FinalData = subject + y + x
4. Then we make a new set called Madetidy by calculating mean and standard deviation using their necessary codes.
5. We label each column appropriately:
Acc = Accelerometer
Mag = Magnitude
f = Frequency
t = Time
Gyro = Gyroscope
BodyBody = Body
-mean() = Mean
-std() = Standard Deviation
6. Finally Namedata is created which contains the mean and standard deviation of each variable.
